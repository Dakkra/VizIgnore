A visual GUI for working with .gitignore files

# Purpose
To allow GIT users to graphically (and eventually textually) select and modify the .gitignore file in GIT repositories.

Based on [https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore)

# Screenshots
I wish... but alas... this program is still in alpha and has not a GUI yet
